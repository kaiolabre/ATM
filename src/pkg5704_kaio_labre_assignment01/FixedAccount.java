/*
Fixed offers the biggest interest rate, however it is only calculated after a fixed contract period. 
If user witdraws before this contract period, they receive no interest (assume any withdrawal is too early, 
so keep track of early withdrawal in a boolean attribute for the class). Fixed account has no daily withdraw limit.

NOTE: Donâ€™t worry about time and dates. Assume someone is writing that side of the project. 
So for calculating interest just provide a function to add interest to the account and assume it will be called at the right times. 
The special case for this in the Fixed Account, which may yield no interest if withdrawn from early.
